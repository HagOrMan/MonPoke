# MonPoke

A fun pokemon style game which allows you to catch new pokemon and explore different maps!

Use WASD or the arrow keys to move your aiming left and right, or increase/decrease the force of the throw. Use 'X' to throw, 'Z' to reset your pokeball after a throw, or 'C' to reset your pokeball and look for a new pokemon!
